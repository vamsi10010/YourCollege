# YourCollege - College Recommender System

YourCollege is a college recommender application that takes into consideration a users preferences about a college (both quantitative and qualitative aspects are considered) before suggesting a list of closely related colleges for you. 

It uses an <b>Unsupervised Weighted K-Means Algorithm</b> to classify the master list of colleges into 40 different clusters based on the similarity of colleges. 

We have collected data sets about the different colleges in the U.S, their acceptance details, racial distribution, gender ratio, academic requirements and many others.

The user interface is built and hosted on Streamlit.

YourCollege began as a hackathon idea for BoilerMake 2023 at Purdue University. Since then, we have upgraded the application from a command-line interface to a complete graphical user interface hosted on Streamlit.
